Howdy, 
This here’s my database design project for horror movies.

Includes:
- ER diagram (`real_er.drawio.png`)
- Relational schema (`horror_movies_rs.drawio.drawio-2.png`)

ER Diagram shows movies, actors, directors, genres, and how they all tie together.
Relational Schema shows tables, keys, and linking tables.

*ain’t no messy redundancies here*

Much obliged for takin' a look.
